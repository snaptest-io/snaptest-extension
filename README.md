Verifying SHA-256 hash of a release package
-----------
Adding an extension in developer mode may open some privacy concerns as there isn't "oversight" by the Chrome 
Extension Support team. Open-sourcing the code gives some community visibility & accountability of the code.  
When you download a package from the [versions page](https://www.snaptest.io/doc/archives), it's important that you 
know that package comes from this repository.

In order to accomplish this, we use a SHA-256 hashing mechanism so you can mathematically prove this fact
for any version release.

1. Check this repository out to a version tag you'd wish to verify. 
( e.g. find the commit tagged 5.3.0 & checkout HEAD to that commit hash.)
1. Make sure all developer dependencies listed in the [Contributors Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) are installed.
1. Run `./scripts/package.sh` which will produce a SHA-256 hash, ie:
    ```
    Packaging complete. 
   Checksum (SHA-256 of zip's inner /dist directory): d8f26b988138ff02fa02366654b19e259aa7a6d46d58bc7cf95e757a8597c603
   ```
1. Match the above hash to the published hash [on the downloads page](https://www.snaptest.io/doc/archives).

This proves that the code you're looking in this repository is exactly what was built in 
that .zip file that you previously downloaded.
